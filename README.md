## Description
An automated library management system is a software solution designed to automate and optimize library processes. It provides tools for efficient inventory, cataloging, storage and retrieval of books, as well as management of checkout and return of materials, helping to improve library operations and provide a better patron experience. 
  
Design patterns such as MVVM, Repository and UnitOfWork were used. Connection to the database was made using the Entity Framework.
